# Style variations (`styles/*.json`)

Use this file when adding or debugging style variations.

Key points:

- Style variations are JSON files in `styles/`.
- Users can pick a style variation in the UI.
- Once selected, the choice is stored in the DB (so “changing the JSON file” may not update what a user already selected).
